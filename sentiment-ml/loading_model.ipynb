      "Review: [\"I love digimon but I couldn't really get into this game.  It's fun for a while but gets way too grindy even more than other mmos that I play. It also doesn't feel very rewarding when it comes to completing quests as much as others do.  The graphics are vastly outdated but yet seem to be a bit much for even high end computers, I have a desktop than can run just about any other mmo on it's highest settings, I'm not sure why and how this one seems to drop frames and studder so much.  Pros+almost every single digimon can be obtained+when you do obtain the digimon you wanted, that's when it feels rewarding+battling digimonCons-outdated graphics-very very grindy-dull characters-very little character customization-a rough interfaceVerdictI don't recommend this as a game but rather as a grind to collect digimon.\"]\n",

      "Review: ['Early Access ReviewOne of the most OVERHYPED Twitch promoted games I have ever played. Has the worst glitches, bullet registration, lag compensation, car mechanics, recoil patterns, pay for skin systems, hackers(anti-cheat), communities, and staff/devs than any game in the market. This is just anotherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥polished \"Alpha\" scheme designed to take your money and provide no effort on making it a better game. They just release another sub-portion of the game which they will make you pay for if you want to try it. The streamers of this game are in a constant rage fueled hatred for the game mechanics and publically trash this hogwash of a game daily. The American servers are full of racist, triggerbotters, and Chinese.... If you expect to be able to get flawless shots that will never happen.... If you expect the hitboxes for the Chinese players (half the lobbies you\\'ll join) to be the same as the American players well thats not going to happen.... Imagine trying to slingshot a headless chicken running through a barn. This is 2017 and the game industry is booming, but these people at Daybreak do not give two flying f\\'s about you or their game. Treat yourself to honest developers or stick to triple A releases because this game is a joke.']\n",

Pros:1. Amazing Digimon Designs2. Fun Dungeons You Can Run With Guild/Friends3. Very Challenging When It Comes To Getting Equipment (Earings, Rings, Necklaces)4. QuestLine Follows Anime Story Line In Multiple SeasonsCons:1. GUI Not The Best2. P2P Players Tend To Boost Price Up Cause Of Greed3. Some Instore Items Has To Be Bought To Progress (Bokomon Books, BM Items)4. Lots Of ScammersInBetween:1. Bots - But In This Server GM's Are Trying Their Best To Remove Them2. GrindFest - You Basically Grind For OursI personally enjoy this game cause of the grind aspect and I enjoy Digimon ever since I was a kid. But these are basically what the game is all about. I only wish to make this more fair for those who cant spend money cause they dont have any or they need it for irl stuff and make items dropable even if its a low percent.\"]\n",
