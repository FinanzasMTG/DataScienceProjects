# 👋🏻 Hello and Welcome!

## 📈 Description

In this repository you will find some some of my Data Science work and my technical skills.

At the moment, you can find a machine learning model created with Python (SciKit) which can predict the sentiment of any gaming review.

# Review Sentiment - Machine Learning Project
## 🕹️ Getting Started

You can either download the Python script named '[sentiment-ml](https://github.com/FinanzasMTG/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/sentiment-ml/sentiment_ml.ipynb)' (Jupyter Notebook format) and run it to see how the model performs. Feel free to run further optimisations! You might want to download the datasets in the 'data' folder, too.

In case you just want to play with the model itself, you just need the following files:
* _count_vect_ (the vectoriser)
* _data/finalized_model.sav_ (the model)
* _loading_model.ipynb_ (the script to load the model)

You can then run the '[test_reviews.csv](https://github.com/FinanzasMTG/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/sentiment-ml/data/test_reviews.csv)' dataset through the model or write your own review. Your choice!

### 📖 Libraries:

* random
* pandas
* json
* sklearn
* pickle

## 🤔 Help

The sentiment Machine Learning project was created using **JupyterLab 3.0.11** and tested on Google Colab. Should you run into any error, please reach out!
